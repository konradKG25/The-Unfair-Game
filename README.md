# The Unfair Game
This is The Unfair Game. A simple Y6 (school years) and above based math game where you specify how many teams do you want in the game, maybe teams of friends, classmates or yourself. Then you get asked how many questionds do you want. Then the game goes for each team and asks a random maths question, when the ammount of questions have been answered already, the team with the highest ammount of points wins! If you get a question correct, you get to pick whether you want to keep or give the hidden points (untill decided to keep or who to give to) to a team (unless you go into the `game.config` file wich comes with the game and set the 0 to 1 to turn on allow visibility of the points before deciding what to do with them.
